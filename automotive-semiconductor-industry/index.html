Semiconductor Chip Shortage Holds the Auto Industry Back on Production From onelectrontech.com
As vehicles become considerably complex, demand for automotive semiconductors will increase logically and give an incredible long term development motor for the automotive. Infineon, nxp, and renesas were the biggest automotive semiconductor. This automotive world report considers how the chip shortage is impacting automotive production, development and thinking.
