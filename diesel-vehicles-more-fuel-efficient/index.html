Ford Unveils 2018 F150, New Diesel Engine, More Efficient Gas Engines From theintelligentdriver.com
Diesel engines are still far more efficient than petrol engines at converting fuel to mechanical energy. Diesel cars also tend to have more torque, which results in more impressive acceleration. Diesel engines are still more efficient than gas engines, but less efficient. Diesel cars also tend to have more torque, which results in more impressive acceleration.

<p>Let’s just compare how efficiently each car uses the energy within these fuels. A standard diesel fuel has approximately 38.8 mega joules of energy/litre while the petrol yields 34.8 mega joules of energy/litre. Because diesels use a higher compression rating than gasoline engines, they tend to be more efficient. Diesel engines get between a quarter and a third better “gas” mileage than.</p>
